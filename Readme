Modification including:
1 The communication network of swarm constructed by Xbee modules, so add uart driver supporting Xbee api protocol.
2 Add data view, flight path view, control commands for swarm in MissionPlanner.
3 Modify mavlink send function, so that sending head, payload and check bytes calls write() only once.
